I want us to make a few changes to the ordering flow so we can start testing real orders properly.

For now, we should pause full automated checkout. I don’t want to rely on webhooks or payment verification yet since I’m still learning the backend side.

What I want us to implement instead is a Beta Order flow using WhatsApp, but done cleanly and intentionally.

Here’s what I need you to change:

1️⃣ After a user finishes building their deck, replace the main CTA with “Order (Beta)”.
Add a small helper text below it that says something like:
“We’re in beta. Orders are processed manually to ensure quality and collect feedback.”

2️⃣ Before redirecting, validate that the deck is complete:
– at least one category selected
– valid number of questions
– a card back design selected
If anything is missing, block the order and show a clear error message.

3️⃣ On click of Order (Beta), generate a simple deck summary object (we’ll reuse this later when we automate checkout).
It should include:
– a generated deck ID
– selected categories
– total card count
– selected card back design
– price
– estimated delivery time

4️⃣ Use that summary to redirect the user to WhatsApp with a pre-filled message.
The message should clearly show their deck details and ask for next steps for payment and delivery.

5️⃣ The redirect should use the wa.me format with the message URL-encoded so it works on both mobile and desktop.

6️⃣ After redirecting, show a confirmation screen telling the user that once they send the WhatsApp message, I’ll guide them through payment and delivery manually.

The key thing here is that this flow should not feel like a workaround. It should feel like an early-access, concierge-style ordering experience.

Also, please structure things in a way that when we’re ready later, we can easily swap this WhatsApp step with a proper Paystack checkout without rewriting the whole flow.

Let me know if anything here feels unclear or if you see a better way to implement it. Once we align, you can go ahead and make the changes.

Thanks 🙏
